# Balloon Interface

Balloon Interface is a coordinator dashboard used during ICPC regionals to track teams’ seating locations and monitor solved problems, enabling volunteers to deliver balloons to the correct desks as part of ICPC contest culture.

## Overview
During onsite ICPC contests, teams receive balloons when they solve problems. This project helps coordinators and volunteers quickly identify:
- Which team has solved a problem
- Where the team is seated
- Which balloon needs to be delivered

This improves on-ground coordination and reduces delays in balloon delivery.

## Use Case
Designed for use during ICPC regionals (onsite), where smooth and fast balloon delivery is an important part of the contest experience.

## Status
This project was developed for contest operations and coordination support during ICPC Regionals.
